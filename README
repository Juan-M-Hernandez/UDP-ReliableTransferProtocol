Compiling and Running Server
===============================
To compile a simple "make" will compile the server.c
into the executable server file.
Running the server requires a valid portnumber to be
specified.

EX:
$./server 11300

At most 5 simultaneous connections will be accepted,
the server will continue to handle requests indefinitely until
it receives a SIGINT command through a Ctrl-C input.
